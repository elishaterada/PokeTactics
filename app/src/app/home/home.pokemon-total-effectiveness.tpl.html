  <small class="text-muted">Total effectiveness is a simple sum of all selected Pokémon's effectiveness from 0 (immune) to 4 (super effective). The chart provides a good picture of what move types are generally effective and ineffective against the team of Pokémon. Use this during battle against your opponent to pick the right Pokémon for battle or use it against your own team to find strength / weakness.</small>
